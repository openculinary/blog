This week's update includes a video feature-preview of the (oft-touted, rarely progressed) multi-device collaboration feature.

The user interface is intended to be as straightforward as possible. You'll pick a username and a 'room name' - a shared name for the place you'd like your meal plan and shopping list to be available - and by providing that room name to your friends or other devices, they'll be able to participate equally in the session.

There'll be no user account to create - and thus no login details to remember or worry about, no unwanted marketing or risk of spam emails - and none of your personal information will be shared with RecipeRadar.

Attached is a short video clip of the feature as it currently exists in development - demonstrating me adding a note to a shared shopping list from another device.

As usual, we're building upon functionality provided by other free and open source components. In this case credit is due to the [`YJS`](https://yjs.dev/) collaborative

editing library, and the [`CodeMirror`](https://codemirror.net/) text editor.
